    <h3>Faults in Empiricism</h3>

    <p>The belief that the world doesnt exist outside of your mind is bourgeois and sollipsistic.
        This philosophy was a reaction to religion and rationalism. Which, in their own ways tried to explain the world in definite terms externally.
        The line of thought here is that if you cant touch feel or see it then it isnt real. 
        There is a throughline from here directly to our neoliberal individuality fetishism that is so pervasive in our culture nowadays.
